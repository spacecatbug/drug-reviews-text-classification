# Text classification of drug review data

In this text mining task, text classification is performed in an attempt to predict the effectiveness of drugs from patient reviews. The data that is being used for the text classification is publically available and was originally obtained by crawling online pharmaceutical review sites.

The patient review data is processed as word embeddings using a pre-trained model. These embeddings are then used to train a model which is used to predict the drug effectiveness on a test dataset.
