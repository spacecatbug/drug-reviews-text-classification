        "The reviews contain a very large range of words and it would take a lot of computational power to include every single unique word when training a model. We can use term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) which is a statistic that measures how important words are to a corpus (the set of all reviews). TF-IDF depends on how many times a word appears in a single document and also how many different documents that word appears in.\n",
        "\n",
        "Higher TF-IDF values are given to words that appear  frequently within a single document *AND* if that word appears in a smaller number of documents. This means that if these words are seen in a document, it will be easier to predict what classification that document belongs to, based on that word. Using intuition, a word like `the` would have a low TF-IDF because it would probably appear in all documents. A word like `headache` may have a high TF-IDF because it seems like a word that would appear in a smaller number of reviews, and intuitively it would seem that this word highly suggests that the drug review is negative, for example. A word that is completely unique and only appears once in all the reviews would have a low TF-IDF because it appears infrequently in a single document (an example of this could be a misspelled word, like `headahce`.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will also allow for up to groups of 2 words and 3 words (called bi-grams and tri-grams) to be included for this analysis. In this example, `side effect` is a bi-gram and results in a high TF-IDF score of 54.122304."
