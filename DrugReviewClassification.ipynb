I found it very effective, despite only dabbing on the smallest amount due to only having small sample tube.  Yet despite quick clear-ups...I would occasionally have recurrances under my nose with the rash.  I have struggled with this rash for over 20 years.  With the last outbreak, while having minimal amounts left in the sample tube, I went in to my dermatologist and got a full prescription in about June of 2009.  Not only was I able to use a bit more in application this time, but it obviously was not an expired product.  I found the long-term rash hsf completely cleared up within less than a week.  While this was not new to me with this product, the fact that I have had no recurrance whatsoever in over four months is the great news. Absolutely none After washing my face with my long-term personal choice of face wash (Alpha Hydrox foaming face wash) and using a Strident sensitive skin cleaning pad, I would apply the Noritate cream sparingly over the rash under my nose at night.

It made me very, very tired, so I take it before bed and sleep wonderfully. With 40mg dosage - increased sweating, faintness, nearly passing out. I started with the 20mg dosage and it seemed to be working pretty well until about a month in when I had a bad anxiety attack.  After seeing the doctor, she upped me to 40mg.  After one dosage of 40mg, I nearly passed out twice and started profusely sweating.  My hearing also went all funny.  The doctor advised me to drop back down to 20mg and then try to go back up to the 40mg.  Emotionally, I felt better after the 40mg, even after nearly fainting, but the side effects were very bad.

During the period there may have been three incidences where it seemed like an attack was coming on (curing exertion and cold, damp weather) but simply a better environment and a couple of cups of coffee warded it off.  There are times of wheezy, heavy-chestedness, but these are minimal in comparison to prior to taking Advair. Wallet shock.  Patient seems to overall fall asleep easier, but tends to have some problems getting a deep sleep, but this may or may not be related to the Advair.  Other than that, there do not seem to be any adverse side effects  -- casually or medically -- after about 1-1/2 years of taking the medication. The patient developed asthma four years ago.  It was controlled on an 'attack' basis, generally with an OTC inhaler.  When most OTC inhalers were taken off the market prior to reformulation, and a severe asthma attack, a prescription inhaler was prescribed, but it was being used more often than should, and did not alleviate the problems.  After a thorough examination, the doctor prescribed Advair, as directed with two puffs/inhales daily, morning and evening (at least 8 hours apart).  The patient is examined/tested every three months prior to refilling prescription to ensure there are no side-effects or adverse reactions. \"\n",

The biggest side-effect was that it made me experience shock-waves through my head and sometimes even my body, just like if someone would have turned on and off a lamp very quickly. That side-effect ended the same time I stopped taking Seroquel. The other one was that everything started to smell and taste very bad. It\\xef\\xbf\\xbds hard to explain exactly how, but it was a mix of vodka and mould. After I stopped taking the medication it took 2 weeks for the taste/smell-problem to disapear.

Also severe cramping and urgency to empty the bowel was decreased by 50% and meals could be enjoyed, even when out in public places where a washroom might not be available.

I then began taking it again and side effects returned. Vytorin was prescribed by my doctor for me for my high cholesterol. I took it for about a month and did not like the side effects. From the day that I began taking Vytorin I had diarrea. At first I thought it was purely coincidental until I stopped taking it for a few days. The side effects vanished. I took it again and they returned. I told my doctor about this and they switched me to Pravastatin ( same dosage) and the same side effects occurred. I then stopped taking the prescription. '\n",
            " b'Tramadol decreases the severity of pain associated with neck movement. It is not an opiate however it does provide pain relief (for me) along the lines of a mild narcotic without the \"euphoric\" or mind numbing effects. It allows me greater latitude of neck movement. It is very evident to me when the medication is wearing off as I can no longer turn my neck more than approximately 25 degrees. This drug has been a lifesaver for me and can sometimes even head off my milder migraines. I\\'ve personally experienced no side effects other than an occasional jerky type feeling in my movements. I have heard from others that this medication, although non narcotic can be difficult to cease due to withdrawal symptoms. Personally I have  had no problem with this. This medication has been known to cause seizures and is not to be taken by anyone who has experienced a seizure. I take two 50 mg. tablets as needed up to three times a day. '\n",

After about a week I began to get extremely moody - crying a lot, getting very angry and agitated.  It appeared that once the medication started building up in my system the side effects became worse and worse.  It was not worth it and I quit the medication within a few weeks. '\n",
            " b\"This drug did work at alleviating the anxiety for which it was prescribed. My God, I'm amazed that this drug is still on the market. I'm actually an MD, and was prescribed this drug for anxiety and panic attacks. I know to give a drug about a month to work, but I lasted all of 3 days on this!! Started with a 75 mg dose, immediately fell asleep for 4 hours, woke up feeling so out of it that I could barely string a sentence together, spent the next day feeling nauseous, hot, sweaty, jittery and weak. Got leg spasms that night and woke up 12 hours post-ingestion having a rebound panic attack. When morning finally arrived, I had the kind of hangover headache that you get when you're in college and have spent the night parting and binge drinking, but without any of the fun. The next day, upon advice from my psychiatrist, I dropped the dose right down to 25 mg, with no change in side effects. 3rd day I tried only 6.25 mg (quarter of a 25 mg pill), and still felt nauseous, hot, dizzy and weak...and fell asleep for two hours. This is now day 6 and I'm finally recovering from my 3 day trip to hell with Effexor. Left a 5 min message on my psychiatrist's machine - will not be taking this crap anymore!! Will not EVER be prescribing this to any of my patients. 75 mg per day starting dose for anxiety and panic attacks. \"\n",

The drug is mainly intended for anxiety and works great at relieving those systems such as irregular heart beat, nervousness and other anxiety causing symptoms. I give it a 9 out of 10 for its performance. The only thing i didnt like about this drug is that with taking it overtime I felt as if my body built tolerance to the drug as well as became more dependent on it. I still am until this day and have managed to ween off the drug. Then again every ones body is different, Just do your research before taking benzodiazepines long term. The treatment overall treated my anxiety quickly and effectively. No regrets. The drug overall has treated me effectively despite the minor drawbacks. '\n",
            " b'My cholesterol levels were very high.  Te plan was to take Lipitor for one month and then see if the levels were lower. No benefits were identified because I could not take take  the medicine long enough to get a second  cholesterol test to measure for measuring any decrease in my cholesterol levels.  After having side effects, I did try to lower the dosage to 10m by cutting the pills in half, but still felt the bad effects. At first, I did not associate my increasing tiredness and general lack of energy with the medicine. I just thought I was getting sick with a virus. Then, as time went on, I started to also experience muscle soreness and tightness.  By the time I started to think the way I was feeling might be related to the Lipitor, I realized, besides the physical symptoms,  I was in a state of depression.  As soon as I quit taking the pills, all the bad symptoms cleared.  A few days later, I tried taking less (half), but, again started feeling bad. As previously stated, because my cholesterol levels were high, the doctor said I should take Lipitor for one month and then we would retest the cholesterol levels to see if the medicine was effective in lowering the levels. But, because I was unable to take the Lipitor for the entire month, the  second  cholesterol test was never taken.  After taking the Lipitor for about 10 days, I stopped taking it.  A few days later, I did try to take just half a pill.  But within days, the side effects started to return. '\n",

I picked at my skin until permanently damaged. I had horrible dry mouth and I had bad breath. My sister was diagnosed with ADHD and so was my brother (Both were much younger 11 and 7 years younger) Both suffered from learning disabilities. I drove my sister to an appointment and due to my family history I was asked to take a questionair. I was then told that while I was not learning disabled (A Student), I was hyper and did I want to try the above drugs. They said I would never know how bad off I was until I knew what it felt like to be normal. I was given two perscriptions and was told to start with one dose of the dexedrine in the am and to take the Depekote and dexedrine in the afternoon. If that didn\\'t do it they would up my dexedrine. With in about two months I felt like jumping from my skin and decided that organization was not that worth it.

Further, you are told to consume food to protect the lining of your stomach from this medication.  Not always something you want to do when you are experiencing a lot of pain because pain can make you feel like vomiting. Stomach issues, burning  The more adverse affect was the constant pain due to the continuing inflammation with the added and increasing reduction in movement, and muscle usage.  Worst, was the waste of time.  Another med could have been prescribed in the time I used this medicine that would have been more effective and time healing would not have been wasted.  In fact, another anti-inflammatory was prescribed that provided immediate benefits (30 minutes) without the build-up in your system that the M.D. and pharmacist said Naprosyn requires before it becomes effective. Tried various dosages from the lowest, to more frequency.  It simply had little affect on inflammation or pain.  No other pain medication was added to this treatment and no other medication was given.  I had a car accident and suffered whiplash, thoracic muscle strain, herniation of entire lumbar region, etc.  Inflammation was rampant from hip level up.  Any relief would have been noted and appreciated.  Another drug was later prescribed, another anti-inflammatory, which proved just how much the naprosyn did not work.  I had immediate pain relief in 30 minutes and notable inflammation reduction very quickly.  In fact, after a 3 week loading of this drug, I was able to get out of bed, move around, and be functional!  The Doctor insisted on trying this level, Naprosyn, first and then changed after 6 weeks, to supposedly stronger medication in some kind of protocol progression.  I now tell my doctors which medication works and refuse anything else.  They waste time on ineffective medications allowing suffering.

My trigyceride levels improved significantly but was not within normal limits. My triglyceride level was 503.

It was very uncomfortable, even if I had the airconditioning on.  After several days, I started having muscle pains on both my legs.  I was losing sleep becasue I was so uncomfortable and could no longer tolerate taking the medicine.
