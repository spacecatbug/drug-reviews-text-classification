# Text classification of drug review data

## Aim

The aim is to try and predict the effectiveness of drugs from online drug review websites by using text mining and machine learning.

## Introduction

When new medicines are developed, many phases of clinical trials and research are undertaken in order to gain legislative approval for them to be sold to the public. Although this process can be expensive and span many years, they are conducted over a limited sample population over a fixed period of time. At times, long-term effects of drugs, or highly uncommon side effects may not be uncovered until a large enough population tries the drug. Analysing online reviews for drugs is a great opportunity for monitoring the success of a drug. Because online reviews are continually updated, this is also a great source of up to date information which can be used to monitor any quality degradations of existing drugs in the market.
